# Run_Local_Server
Bash script to run a HTTP server on a local network.

## Use:
This Bash script was created to access or see personal computer files from another device inside a local network.
It creates a HTTP server using a python3 command.

### Prerequisites:
If not installed:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install python3
```
It **requires sudo permissions** in order to add rule to firewall. After executing it will delete that same rule and firewall status will be the same as it was.

### To run:
You can provide path to directory and port.
Script retrieves your machine's ipv4 address.

Or you can just place the executable inside the desired folder and `cd` into that folder, then run in terminal:
```
bash run_local_server.sh
```
>If you chose that then just press enter, else type the path to the desired directory.

>Then you will be prompted to choose a port, just press enter, else change it to whatever you want.

>If everything ran successfully you now have a HTTP server running on local network.

>Connect your second device to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

>Connect to the server by typing the **underlined text** in the search bar in your second device's browser, et voi lÃ¡! (You can also check it out from your personal computer typing the same!) 

>To stop server and delete firewall's added rules press **_Ctrl-C_**.
