# Run_Local_Server
Bash script to run a HTTP server on a local network.

## Use:
This Bash script was created to access or see personal computer files from another device inside a local network.
It creates a HTTP server using a python3 command.

### Prerequisites:
If not installed:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install python3
```
It **requires sudo permissions** in order to turn off firewall. After executing it will turn it back on.

### To run:
Just place the executable inside the desired folder and `cd` into that folder, then run in terminal:
```
bash run_local_server.sh
```
If you chose that then just press enter, else type the path to the desired directory.

Then you will be prompted to choose a port, just press enter, else change it to whatever you want.

If everything ran successfully you now have a HTTP server running on local network.
Connect your second device to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.
Connect to the server by typing the **underlined text** in the search bar in your second device's browser, et voi l√°!
(You can also check it out from your personal computer typing the same!) 

To stop server and reactivate firewall press **_Ctrl-C_**.
